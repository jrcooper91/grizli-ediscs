# GRIZLI for z = 0.5 EDisCS Clusters 

This repository contains scripts for running grizli [gbrammer/grizli](https://github.com/gbrammer/grizli), an HST grism reduction pipeline. This research constitutes
a majory portion of my dissertation work (University of Kansas, Physics) on H-alpha based star-formation rates in 3 environments:
cluster core, infall region, and field. There are 14 pointings at 2-orbit depth observed with WFC3/G102.

Data reduction is done [blindly](https://github.com/jrcooper91/grizli-ediscs/tree/master/no_prior) (grism-determined redshift) and with a [prior](https://github.com/jrcooper91/grizli-ediscs/tree/master/gaussian_prior) from previous ground-based observations (Just et al. 2019). Each pointing has to be run separately and data products are in a separate directory. 

# Data Products & Results 

Grizli produces 1D & 2D spectra, line fluxes, and stellar/emission line maps for each source. 

This project is in progress and results will be submitted for publication shortly.
