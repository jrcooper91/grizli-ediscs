# GRIZLI for z = 0.5 EDisCS Clusters 

This repository contains scripts for running grizli (gbrammer/grizli), an HST grism reduction pipeline. This research constitutes
a majory portion of my dissertation work (University of Kansas, Physics) on H-alpha based star-formation rates in 3 environments:
cluster core, infall region, and field. There are 14 pointings at 2-orbit depth observed with WFC3/G102.

Data reduction is done blindly (grism-determined redshift) and with a prior from previous ground-based observations (Just et al. 2019).
